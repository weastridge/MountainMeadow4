5/13/24 reading up on wpf layout, sizing, etc.  Don't seem to find an easy way to change the font on the main window title bar, though it is supposedly possible per https://www.actiprosoftware.com/community/thread/21421/change-the-font-in-the-window-title-bar
6/13/24 decided on starting size for main window, see TestingM4 for discussion
Height="922" Width="1548"
Renamed MainWindow to LoginWindow, to allow main program window to be called MainWindow.  
Looking into ways to include my semaphore trick by Francesco Balena in startup.  I'm wary
of creating a separate static Main() entry point; probably will have to put it in LoginWindow.xaml.cs
(unless I can think of a way to put it inApp.xaml.cs) and just close the window if user directs to.
