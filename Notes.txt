5/13/24 reading up on wpf layout, sizing, etc.  Don't seem to find an easy way to change the font on the main window title bar, though it is supposedly possible per https://www.actiprosoftware.com/community/thread/21421/change-the-font-in-the-window-title-bar
6/13/24 decided on starting size for main window, see TestingM4 for discussion
Height="922" Width="1548"
Renamed MainWindow to LoginWindow, to allow main program window to be called MainWindow.  
Looking into ways to include my semaphore trick by Francesco Balena in startup.  I'm wary
of creating a separate static Main() entry point; probably will have to put it in LoginWindow.xaml.cs
(unless I can think of a way to put it inApp.xaml.cs) and just close the window if user directs to.
7/2/24 looking at best object to reference for program piece display- settled on UserControl, which hosts any sort of panel.  It can be assigned to a grid, for example, and if necessary the grid can host a winforms System.Windows.Forms.Control (which we used in MM3) as a child using System.Windows.Forms.Integration.WindowsFormsHost host
Notice what is called .Net 8-Windows is .Net Core and the currently preferred framework.  .NetFramework v4.8 still works but is not being further developed going forward.  We'll use .Net 8.
7/4/24 did that.  Next to make a Program Component Display (PP is now PC).  It will be hosted by a ContentControl in ProgramWindow.
7/9/24 did that.  Now to connect to database.
Trying to connect to download users, but that means defining people, which need codified gender identities, which was accessed in database..  Will decide whether to hard code that.
7/10/2024  Just importing some of the mm3common stuff to MM4Common;  after 3 hours, I still have 90 warnings, 279 messages, and haven't even started IMM4Data yet.  Mostly involve the new handling of nulls by C# that requires declaring if null is allowed.
7/11/24 2 hrs on MM4Types.cs;  down to 61 messages.
7/12/24 got the warnings and messages fixed in MM4Types, but there are more in CommHelpers, including the complaint that static members shouldn't be visible (public).  I may need to move those into a separate project called HL7 or something so they will be internal.
